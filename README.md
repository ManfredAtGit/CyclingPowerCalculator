# YAWC (Yet Another Watt Computer) 
is a web application that visualizes and animates the movement and power output (watt) of a cyclist under the influence of different forces. It includes features like speed control, wind direction and force, and power display.

The application uses client-side only Javascipt

[View on github pages](https://manfredatgit.github.io/CyclingPowerCalculator/)

Key features include:

## Visualization
- Uses Three.js for rendering the 3D scene, including the cyclists (represented by bicycle icons).
- however: currently this application is pure 2D

## User Controls
- **Ascent Slider**: Controls the ascent/descend (currently not yet used for power calculation).
- **Speed Slider**: Controls the speed of the cyclists.
- **Wind Force Slider**: Controls the force of the wind.
- **Wind Direction Control**: A circular control to set the wind direction.

## Dynamic Elements
- Cyclist movement, responding to the speed slider.
- Wind arrows, showing direction and intensity.
- **Power Display**: Calculates and displays the cyclist's power output (in Watts), changing the color of a lightbulb icon.
- **Heart Rate Display**: Calculates and displays estimated heart rate (in bpm), and animates a heart icon.

## Responsive Design
- The canvas adapts to the window size.

# Key Code Sections

## HTML (body)
- **Canvas (`#visualizationCanvas`)**: The rendering area for the 3D scene.
- **Ascent Slider (`#ascentSlider`)**: A slider to control the ascent of the ride (currently not used for power calculation).
- **Speed Slider (`#speedSlider`)**: A slider to control the speed of the bicycle.
- **Wind Force Slider (`#windForceSlider`)**: A slider to control the wind force.
- **Wind Direction Control (`#windDirectionControl`)**: A circular control to set wind direction.
- **Power Display (`#powerDisplay`)**: Displays calculated power.
- **Power Bulb (`#powerBulb`)**: A lightbulb icon, its color changes with power.
- **Heart Beat Display (`#heartBeatDisplay`)**: Displays calculated heart rate.
- **Heart Beat Icon (`#heartBeatIcon`)**: An icon that beats with the heart rate.

## CSS (style)
- Basic styling for the canvas, sliders, and controls.
- Minimal 3D effects.
- Positioning and layout of the control elements.
- Styling for the wind direction control.
- Styling for wind arrows.
- Styling for the power display and bulb.
- Styling for the heart beat display and icon.

## JavaScript (script)

### Three.js Setup
- Creates a `WebGLRenderer`, `Scene`, and `PerspectiveCamera`.
- Sets up `OrbitControls` for camera interaction (though rotation and zoom are disabled).

### Cyclist Representation
- Creates `bikeCount` number of cyclists, each represented by a `<div>` element containing a bicycle icon (`<i class="fas fa-bicycle"></i>`).
- Cyclists are positioned randomly in the 3D space.
- Cyclists move with a fixed speed.

### Slider Interaction
- **`speedSlider`**: Updates the speed variable, which affects cyclist movement.
- **`windForceSlider`**: Updates the windForce variable, which affects the speed of the wind arrows and the power calculation.

### Wind Direction Control
- **`windDirectionControl`**: Allows the user to drag and rotate an arrow, changing the `windDirection` variable.

### `calculateCyclistPower()`
- Calculates the power a cyclist needs to produce, taking into account cyclist speed, wind speed, wind direction, and cyclist/bike weight.

### `calculateHeartBeatsPerMinute()`
- Estimates the cyclist's heart rate based on power output and functional threshold power (FTP).

### Wind Arrow Creation and Movement
- **`createWindArrow()`**: Creates `<div>` elements with arrow icons (`<i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i>`) to visualize wind.
- Wind arrows are rendered and move across the canvas, their speed and direction determined by the `windForce` and `windDirection`.

### Animation Loop (`animate()`)
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animation.
- Updates cyclist positions.
- Updates wind arrow positions and appearance.
- Renders the 3D scene with Three.js.
- Handles window resizing.
- Updates the power and heart rate displays.

# Libraries and Technologies
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (bicycle, wind arrow, lightbulb, heart).
- **Inter Font**: For the page's font.

# Future work
- dynamic, mobile friendly page layout
- refactor the code to be more modular and easier to maintain (separate in js, html, css files)
- add ascent and descent as input control and use in power calculation
- add further input control for body weight, bike weight, ftp, etc. (possibly use menue control to avoid overcrowded page)
- add more realistic cyclist movement (e.g. using a physics engine)
